## Overview and Origin

* Life by Spot

* Spot Was Founded By Matt Randall and Kip McClanahan in 2017

* Randall came up with the idea to redifined Health insurance. He thought people searching for shortern accident based health insurance was a great market to capture.

* The company Spot Raised $5.85 million in start up money from seed funding. Insurance Policies are issued by Fidelity Life Association and re-insured by Hannover Life Reassurance Company of America. Since then Spot has recived 17.5 million dollars in funding.


## Business Activities:

* The finacial problem that Spot has aimed to solve is the issue of making life insurance more affordable and managable.

* Spot targets people with extreme lifestyles. That includes hikers, mountain bikers, snowboarders and other individuals who participate in extreme sports. Although these individuals would be most suited for Spot's services, their services aren't just limited to them. All individuals who are searching for short term accident based insuraces would find spot's services gratifying. 
* This makes Spot a great compettitor to most life insurace becasue it allows comsumers to pay for what servies they need instead of paying an expensive insurance policy for services they may not need over a long time. 
* An advantage they has over most companies is that it is quick and easy to instate a policy over the phone or app and they don't require a deductable.

* Progressive, Geico, Allstate, Zipari, Metromile, Corvus Insurance,
Kin Insurance

## Results

* Spot is still small comparied to most buisnessness in this domain so their is not much of an affect in this field.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
Some core metrics that other companies use to messure their succcess in this domain are founding, enployee grouth, and value in the stock market. Spot is a privatly owned company and they're valued at only 17.5 million dollars. This is small compared to a company like Geico valued at 33.63 billion. The growth rate of employees of Spot have remained steady over the last few years with no new growth espected.


## Recommendations

*  If I were in a posistion to advise Spot on services they could add to their buisness model, I would suggest adding a tier plan. Spots services are pretty bare bone at the moment and have a teir system would allow them to reach a wider audience. They're currently capped at servicing accident up to only $20,000.

*  I think Spot could utilze machine learning for quicker and more automactic claim processing. This would be appropiate because it would allow the claim processing to be easier and convient for the clients.
